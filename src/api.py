"""Local HTTP API (bonus 5): the search, answer and index commands over
HTTP.

``RagApi`` keeps one retriever and, after the first answer, one model
loaded between requests, so every request after the first is fast. With
the answer cache, a question already answered with the same context is
answered without the model. ``/index`` updates the index on disk and
reloads it, so the server never needs a restart. The responses are the
same pydantic models the CLI prints.
