"""Incremental indexing (bonus 3): re-index only the files that changed.

The saved ``manifest.json`` records the stamp (modification time and
size) of every corpus file. The next ``index`` compares it with the
current files and only reads, chunks, tokenizes and embeds the new and
modified ones; the chunks of modified and deleted files leave both
indexes. Without a usable manifest or index, or with ``--full``, the
whole corpus is indexed again.
