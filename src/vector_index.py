Each chunk is split into windows of about ``MAX_WINDOW_SIZE`` characters
and every window becomes a vector with a small static embedding model.
A chunk scores as its best window, so a long chunk is not diluted by the
average of unrelated parts. The index is built by the ``index`` command
next to the BM25 index and saved as two ``.npy`` files, plus the model
itself (``StaticEncoder``), so a search needs nothing else.
